# SkiffOS: To support crust firmware, we need a arm32 cross-compiler.
# Buildroot can only use 1 toolchain at a time (as of early 2022).
# Workaround: pre-build crust, u-boot with crust-meta and store blobs:
# see https://github.com/skiffos/pinephone-crust-blobs
BR2_PACKAGE_PINEPHONE_CRUST_BLOBS=y

# BR2_TARGET_UBOOT is not set
# BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_USE_DEFCONFIG=y
# BR2_TARGET_UBOOT_BOARD_DEFCONFIG="pinebook-pro-rk3399"
